Planet formation may start during the embedded phase of star formation.  In the scenario where planets form from the embedded disks, resulting in substructures, the chemistry of embedded disks may play a significant role for the chemical composition of the forming planets.  In the recent years, observations discover the emission of carbon-chain molecules and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the center of several embedded protostars, indicating that embedded protostars have developed a complex chemistry at the disk-forming region.  If the forming planets inherit the chemistry of embedded disks, the abundance of complex organic molecules may implicate future developments of organics on the planets. 

Heavier or more complex molecules, such as cyclic-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$, SO, and complex organic molecules (COMs), are in the gas phase at the inner protostellar envelope ($T\gtrsim100$\,K), exclusively tracing the properties of the inner envelope where a disk may be forming \citep{2013ChRv..113.8961A,2014Natur.507...78S}.  The kinematics of a rotating infalling envelope has been analyzed with the observations of heavier or more complex molecules, such as \methanol\ and \dmethanol\ for HH\,212 \citep{2017ApJ...843...27L}, CS for IRAS\,04365$+$2535 \citep{2016ApJ...820L..34S} and L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}, cyclic-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ for L1527 \citep{2014Natur.507...78S}, OCS for IRAS\,16293$-$2422\,A \citep{2016ApJ...824...88O}, and methanol and HCOOH for B335 \citep{2019ApJ...873L..21I}.

In the review by \citet{2009ARA&A..47..427H}, complex molecules are defined as carbon-bearing molecules that contain six atoms or more.  Saturated complex molecules are rich in hydrogen atoms, often called complex organic molecules (COMs), while the unsaturated complex molecules are lack of hydrogen atoms, mostly in the form of long carbon-chain molecules.  While recent observations show several embedded protostars with rich spectra of complex molecules, the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars and its relationship to the star formation process remain poorly understand.  Several protostars are rich in COMs but show little emission of long carbon-chain molecules, such as IRAS 16293$-$2422 \citep{2016A&A...595A.117J}, NGC 1333 IRAS 4A \citep{2004ApJ...615..354B}, B335 \citep{2016ApJ...830L..37I,2019ApJ...873L..21I}, and BHR\,71 (Yang et al. 2020 accepted); some protostars are rich in long carbon-chain molecules but not in COMs, such as L1527 \citep{2010ApJ...722.1633S} and IRAS 15398$-$3359 \citep{2009ApJ...697..769S}.  While the bimodal chemical appearance hints a bimodal evolutionary path, the chemical evolution at the embedded protostars remain ill-constrained as a few protostars show the emission of both COMs and long carbon-chain molecules at different scales, such as L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}. 

The Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES) aims to provide the statistics on the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars.  This program unbiasedly observes 51 embedded protostars with ALMA around 260\,GHz, covering the emission of simple molecules such as CS and H$^{13}$CN as well as the emission of complex molecules including \methanol\ and \methylformate.

\section{Results}
The ALMA image cubes are post-processed to extract 1D spectra for identifying the emission of complex molecules and more in-depth analyses.  Because the complex molecules only sublime at the temperature greater than $\sim$100\,K, we focus on the spectra toward the continuum sources.  Four steps of post-processing reduces the image cubes to 1D spectra, which are summarized below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuum fitting: We use the CASA task \texttt{imfit} to iteratively fit for continuum sources down to 5$\sigma$ of the residual image within the central 70\%\ of the primary beam size (20\arcsec).  For Set3-ID09, the fitting uses a threshold of 4$\sigma$ and extends the mask to the entire primary beam as a continuum source is detected toward the edge of the primary beam where the noise is elevated.
  \item Extracting spectra:  We use the CASA task \texttt{specflux} to extract the mean flux density within the ellipse which has the same major and minor axes as well as the position angle as the fitted continuum sources.
  \item Baseline calibration:  The continuum has been removed before the imaging process; however, the extracted spectra sometimes still show imperfect baselines.  The spectra show significant differences from one to another such as rich emission lines, lack of emission, and broad emission features.  Thus, we manually select the frequency ranges for baseline calibration for each spectral window and each field.
  \item Velocity correction:  Finally, the frequency of the extracted spectra are corrected according to the source velocities.  We collect the source velocities from the literature as well as from the strong emission lines in our spectra.  Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list} lists the adopted source velocities and the corresponding references.
\end{itemize}

Figure\,\ref{fig:continuum} shows the images of the continuum along with the fitted shapes, while the properties of the continuum sources are listed in Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list}.  Our observations detect 50 continuum sources.    The continuum emission appears as compact circular or elliptical shape with no sub-structure.  Some sources show extended continuum emission resembling the shape of outflow cavities.

  \label{fig:continuum}
\end{figure*}

Three sources, EDJ2009-237, Per-emb-60, and EDJ2009-172, have no spectral line detected; therefore, we exclude them from spectral extraction as well as the line identification and modeling.  \textcolor{red}{These threee sources still need to be included for detection number statistics.}

\subsection{Line Identifications and Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
Line identification starts with manual identification and verification for a few sources with rich spectra, including Per-emb-12B and B1-bS.  We use \textsc{splatalogue}\footnote{\href{http://www.splatalogue.net/}{http://www.splatalogue.net/}} to identity the molecular species and use \textsc{xclass} \citep{2017A&A...598A...7M} to verify the identification.  The \textsc{xclass} package is a LTE radiative transfer code that uses the molecular data from the Cologne Database of Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS; \citealt{2001A&A...370L..49M,2005JMoSt.742..215M,2016JMoSp.327...95E}) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; \citealt{1998JQSRT..60..883P}).  An identification needs to satisfy the following criteria.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectra agree with the predicted strengths of the model.
  \item The spectral lines are not all blended with other emission, such as other molecules and the SiO emission tracing the outflows.  The emission of a few species, such as HDCO \&\ \tmethanol, \acetaldehyde\ \&\ \dmethanol, $^{34}$SO \&\ \ethanol, and \dimethylether\ \&\ \dmethylcyanide, are partially blended (blending occurs at a few lines but other lines remain isolated).  The fittings of those species are performed together to verify their identification.
  \item Identified molecules need to be already found toward young stellar objects as summarized in \citet{2018ApJS..239...17M}. 
\end{itemize}
Table\,\ref{tbl:line_id} lists the identified species and transitions.  Only identifiable transitions are listed.  The \textsc{xclass} modeling includes all the transitions in our frequency coverage regardless their Einstein-A values and upper energy levels.  

Systematic spectral fitting using \textsc{xclass} is then applied to all sources using a list of species, compiled from those identifications.  The catalogs used in this study are listed in Appendix\,\ref{sec:catalogs}  The fitting function in \textsc{xclass} includes several optimization algorithms that can be used in series to reduce biases.  We configure the algorithm chain that starts with the genetic algorithm followed by the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization.  The genetic algorithm searches the best-fitting parameters iteratively with generations that evolve like a natural selection, where the better fitting models get less modification over generations.  We setup the genetic algorithm to search for the three best-fitting models after five generations.  Then, the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization applies to the three best-fitting models for 50 iterations to the best-fitting models.  We assume the COMs are all concentrated at the center, simplified as a 2D thin circular disk.  There are four parameters for the \textsc{xclass} modeling, the size of the emitting molecule ($r_\text{COM}$), the excitation temperature ($T_\text{ex}$), the column density ($N_\text{COM}$), and the line width ($\Delta \nu$).  Due to the limited frequency coverage, many species only have a few lines detected, we fix $r_\text{COM}$ as 0\farcs{5}, similar to our beam size, and optimize the model with five excitation temperatures, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 K.  We allow the line width varying between 1.2\,\kms\ to 3.5\,\kms\ for better fitting quality, and the range of the column density for each molecule is chosen according to the strength of the emission.  The range of fitted column densities at different temperatures indicates the uncertainty of the column densities.

\section{Detection Statistics}
We summarize the fraction of sources with detections of molecules in Figure\,\ref{fig:stats}.  The detection statistics include COMs, carbon-chain molecules, and the simple organic molecules, such as CS, \htcn, SO, $^{34}$SO, and SO$_{2}$.  The PEACHES protostars show a great chemical diversity from no molecule detected (\textcolor{red}{B1-bN}) to rich spectra of COMs (e.g. Per-emb-12B).  Detections of COMs and the number of COMs detected show no obvious correlation with the bolometric luminosity and bolometric temperature of the protostars, which are conventional evolutionary indicators.  Low luminosity sources have fewer COMs detected; however, if COMs mostly come from thermally desorption, the region with $T > T_\text{desorption}$ may be smaller for the low luminosity sources, making the emission of COMs fainter and reducing our sensitivity to detect COMs.  We also compare the detection statistics with the mass derived from 9\,mm observations that resolved the sources as a proxy of the central mass \citep{2018ApJS..238...19T}.  The detection statistics show no clear correlation with the central mass; however, the sources with smaller central mass have fewer detections of COMs, \textcolor{red}{which may due to their low luminosity.}

\section{Correlations of COMs}
The chemical evolution of protostars may leave certain patterns in the abundance of molecules as the dynamical evolution determines the density and temperature structures, regulating chemical reactions.  Thus, the abundance of COMs and their correlations provide critical information to constrain the chemical evolution at embedded protostars.  The fitted column density of COMs indicates the abundance of COMs around protostars.  Typically COMs are locked into the ices on dust grains at outer envelope.  \textcolor{red}{The formation of COMs at diffuse clouds relies on non-thermal process, such as cosmic rays, whose contribution is negligible compared to the central warm region.}  Therefore, we take the column density of COMs as a proxy of the abundance of COMs.  

As described in Section\,\ref{sec:modeling}, we fit the column density and line width with different excitation temperatures, which result in a range of column density as its uncertainty.  The comparison between CCH and \methanol\ shows no correlation between these two molecules (Figure\,\ref{fig:cch_ch3oh}), similar to the conclusion in \citet{2018ApJS..236...52H}.  The single dish survey by \citet{2016ApJ...833..125G} shows a correlation between C$_{4}$H, a more complex carbon-chain molecules, and \methanol.  Outflow activity can promote the formation of CCH, which is more efficiency at warm temperature.  In face, the morphology of CCH often traces the outflow cavities seen from CS.  Therefore, the lack of correlation between CCH and \methanol\ may be affected by outflows.

Figure\,\ref{fig:corner} shows the correlations of several COMs selected from their detection rates.  The column density of \methanol\ best correlates with that of \methylcyanide.  \citet{2020A&A...635A.198B} also found the tight correlation between these two molecules.
