\begin{abstract}
  Complex organic molecules (COMs) at the protostellar phase constrain the chemistry at the warm inner envelope as well as the disk-forming region, which may affect the chemical composition of disks and the planet formation therein.  This study introduces the PEACHES survey, an unbiased ALMA chemistry survey toward the Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud and characterize the statistics of the abundance complex organic molecules.  Among the 50 embedded protostars surveyed, 58\%\ have emission of COMs with 56\%\ have \methanol, 32\%\ have \methylformate, and 40\% have N-bearing COMs.  The column densities of COMs modeled with LTE radiative transfer calculations correlate with each other.  Protostellar properties, such as the bolometric luminosities and the bolometric temperatures, have insignificant impact on the correlations.  The similar chemistry of COMs among a diverse sample hints a universal chemistry of COMs at the embedded phase of star formation.  At the same time, the abundance of more complex species, such as \methylformate\ and \dimethylether, relative to that of less complex species, such as \methanol\ and \methylcyanide, increases as the inferred gas column density, suggesting a more efficient production of more complex species at more embedded sources.

Planet formation may start during the embedded phase of star formation.  In the scenario where planets form from the embedded disks, resulting in substructures, the chemistry of embedded disks may play a significant role for the chemical composition of the forming planets.  In the recent years, observations discover the emission of unsaturated complex organic molecules such as carbon-chain molecules \citep[e.g., ][]{2013ChRv..113.8981S,2014Natur.507...78S,2018ApJ...863...88L} and the saturated complex organic molecules \citep[e.g., ][and the ALMA PILS Survey]{2003ApJ...593L..51C,2007AA...463..601B,2016AA...595A.117J} toward the center of several protostellar cores, indicating that embedded protostars have developed a complex chemistry at the warm inner envelope and/or the disk-forming region.  The saturated organic molecules, often called complex organic molecules (COMs), have single covalent bonds for all atoms, making them rich in hydrogen, while the unsaturated organic molecules contain double or triple bonds between carbon atoms, making them poor in hydrogen.  If the forming planets inherit the chemistry of embedded disks, the abundance of complex organic molecules may implicate future developments of organics on the planets. 

The gas-phase COMs typically emit from the inner protostellar envelope ($T\gtrsim100$\,K), which coincidentally corresponds to $\sim$ 100\,au for typical low-mass protostars \citep{2020ApJ...891...61Y}.  Thus, COMs exclusively trace the properties of the inner envelope where a disk may be forming \citep{2013ChRv..113.8961A,2014Natur.507...78S}, tracing the chemistry and dynamics of embedded disks.  The kinematics of a rotating infalling envelope has been analyzed with the observations of heavier or more complex molecules, such as \methanol\ and \dmethanol\ for HH\,212 \citep{2017ApJ...843...27L}, CS for IRAS\,04365$+$2535 \citep{2016ApJ...820L..34S} and L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}, cyclic-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ for L1527 \citep{2014Natur.507...78S}, OCS for IRAS\,16293$-$2422\,A \citep{2016ApJ...824...88O}, and methanol and \thcooh\ for B335 \citep{2019ApJ...873L..21I}.

While recent observations show several embedded protostars with rich spectra of complex molecules, the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars and its relationship to the star formation process remain poorly understood.  Several protostars are rich in COMs but show little emission of long carbon-chain molecules, such as IRAS 16293$-$2422 \citep{2016AA...595A.117J}, NGC 1333 IRAS 4A \citep{2004ApJ...615..354B,2019ApJ...872..196S}, and B335 \citep{2016ApJ...830L..37I,2019ApJ...873L..21I}; some protostars are rich in long carbon-chain molecules but not in COMs, such as L1527 \citep{2010ApJ...722.1633S} and IRAS 15398$-$3359 \citep{2009ApJ...697..769S}.  While the bimodal chemical appearance hints a bimodal evolutionary path, the chemical pathways of complex molecules at the embedded protostars remain ill-constrained as a few protostars show the emission of both COMs and long carbon-chain molecules at different scales, such as L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}.  Recent surveys show lack of correlations between COMs and long carbon-chain molecules, suggesting that observational biases may contribute to the apparent bimodal chemistry \citep{2016ApJ...833..125G,2018ApJS..236...52H}.

Perseus molecular cloud is one of the most active nearby star-forming region, which extends $\sim$10\,pc on the sky.  Infrared and submillimeter surveys reveal more than 400 young stellar objects as well as $\sim$100 dense cores, which contains $\sim$50 Class 0 and I protostars (\citealt{2005AA...440..151H,2008ApJ...683..822J,2013AJ....145...94D}; hereafter the embedded protostars).  The Perseus molecular cloud contains star-forming regions in a wide range of environments.  The majority of protostars in Perseus are associated with two clusters, NGC\,1333 and IC\,348.  NGC\,1333 has significant outflow activity \citep{2013ApJ...774...22P} and a younger age than that of IC\,348.  The embedded protostars associated with IC\,348 lie at the southwest of IC\,348 near a prominent outflow, HH\,211 \citep[e.g., ][]{2009ApJ...699.1584L}.  Most of other embedded protostars at Perseus are related to L1448, L1455, Bernard 1 (B1), and Bernard 5 (B5).  L1448 has active outflows that may regulate the ongoing star formation \citep{2010MNRAS.408.1516C}; The lack of Class 0 protostars in L1455 suggest a slightly more evolved protostellar population that in other regions \citep{2007AA...468.1009H}; B1 exhibits rich spectra of deuterated species \citep{2005AA...438..585R,2005ApJ...620..308M}.  Thus, the Perseus molecular cloud provides the ideal test bed for chemistry in embedded protostars by surveying the protostars within each region and across the entire cloud.

\citet{2018ApJS..236...52H} presented a pilot survey of the chemistry in the Perseus embedded protostars with Nobeyama 45m telescope, which survey all Class 0/I protostars \citep{2007AA...468.1009H} that have the bolometric luminosity (\lbol) greater than 1\,\lsun\ (0.7\,\lsun for protostars in B1 and B5) and the envelope mass greater than 1\,\msun.  This pilot survey probes the molecules such as C$_2$H, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and \methanol\ and find the majority of the sources are neither only rich in \methanol\ or carbon-chain molecules.  They also suggest a possible correlation between the location of sources within the clouds and the chemistry.  Due to the large beam, chemistry survey with single-dish telescopes often more sensitive to COMs in cool temperature \citep[10--20 K;][]{2017ApJ...841..120B}, which may not be directly associated with the COMs thermally desorbed from icy grains.  The high spatial resolution from interferometric observations is crucial for probing the warm COMs at embedded protostars.  With 26 embedded protostars from several star-forming regions, \citet{2020AA...635A.198B} find \methanol\ in about half fo the sample as well as other more complex COMs.  They also investigate the potential origin of COMs and reveal apparent chemical difference among multiple systems.  Despite of the growing sample of COMs detections in embedded protostars, the statistics of COMs occurrence and abundance remain unconstrained due to the biases from the source selection and the limited resolution.  To unbiasedly survey the chemistry, we conducted the Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES) that probes the complex chemistry toward Perseus embedded protostars.  The source selection follows the same criteria as \citet{2018ApJS..236...52H} with a few pointing modifications using the results from the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity Survey (VANDAM) of Perseus protostars \citep{2016ApJ...818...73T}.  The PEACHES survey also probes the outflows of embedded protostars \citep[e.g., NGC1333 IRAS 4C: ][]{2018ApJ...864...76Z}.

Section\,\ref{sec:observations} describes the details of our ALMA observations.  Section\,\ref{sec:analyses} presents the identification of protostellar sources and the methodology of spectral extraction, line identification and modeling.  Section\,\ref{sec:results} show the detection statistics of COMs and their correlations.  Section\,\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the implication of the observed COMs abundance to the current understanding of chemistry of COMs at protostellar sources.  Finally, Section\,\ref{sec:conclusions} summarizes the findings of this study.

\section{Observations}
\label{sec:observations}
% Observation details
The PEACHES observations were conducted in two ALMA projects (2016.1.01501.S and 2017.1.01462.S; PI: N. Sakai), surveying 37 fields toward the Perseus molecular cloud.  Table\,\ref{tbl:obs_projects} lists the details about the ALMA projects used in this study.  ALMA correlator was configured to have 13 spectral windows (spw) at Band 6, which have 12 narrow spws with 480 channels and a wide spw with 980 channels.  The narrow spws were tuned to observe specific molecular species, such as SiO, CS, \methanol\ and \methylcyanide, with a spectral resolution of 122\khz\ ($\sim$0.15\kms), while the wide spw aimed to observe the continuum with a resolution of 0.976\mhz\ ($\sim$0.4\kms).  The frequency setup for the two ALMA projects are largely identical except for the wide continuum window (spw04), which shifts by $\sim$620\mhz.  Table\,\ref{tbl:spw} lists the frequency ranges for each spw.

We use CASA \citep{2007ASPC..376..127M} for standard calibration and imaging of the continuum and spectral lines with \texttt{tclean}.  Because of the rich spectra, we manually flag the lines for the continuum imaging.  The spectra of spw10 and spw11 are combined for the imaging because the broad SiO emission.  The spectra is cleaned down to 0.022\jy, except for the spw04, which is cleaned down to 0.008\jy\ due to its lower spectral resolution.  The line imaging used the ``multiscale'' deconvolver with a robust parameter of 0.5, because the targeted emission traces different spatial scales (e.g. SiO for outflows and COMs for the inner envelope/disk).

The synthesized beam is about 0\farcs{6}$\times$0\farcs{4} (Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list}).  The Perseus molecular cloud is not at a single distance.  Many studies assume a distance of 235\,pc for Perseus based on the maser observations toward NGC 1333 SVS 13 \citep{2008PASJ...60...37H}.  Recently, \citet{2018ApJ...865...73O} derive a distance of 321$\pm$10\,pc for IC 348 using VLBA and a distance of 293$\pm$22\,pc for NGC 1333 using \textit{Gaia} parallaxes.  \citet{2020AA...633A..51Z} combine the \textit{Gaia} parallaxes and photometric data with a Bayesian framework to revise the distances toward different sightlines of Perseus, resulting in distances ranging from 234\,pc to 331\,pc.  In this study, we assume a distance of 300\,pc for the entire Perseus cloud.  Thus, the synthesized beam is about 180\,au$\times$120\,au.

\section{Analyses}
\label{sec:analyses}

\subsection{Identification of Young Stellar Object}
\label{sec:continuum}
In the 37 field of view, 51 continuum peaks are identified.  We use the CASA task \texttt{imfit} to iteratively fit for continuum sources down to 5$\sigma$ of the residual image within the central 70\%\ of the primary beam size (20\arcsec).  For the field centered on Per-emb 16, the fitting uses a threshold of 4$\sigma$ and extends the mask to the entire primary beam as a continuum source, Per-emb 28, is detected toward the edge of the primary beam where the noise is elevated.  The continuum of the multiple systems are manually fitted to the individual continuum peak.  Two protostars, L1448 IRS 2E and SVS 3, become non-detection in our observations due to their low brightness.  SVS 13C locates at the edge of the primary beam, resulting in a noisy continuum.  Thus, we exclude SVS 13C from this study, making a total of 50 protostars.

% distant galaxy does not appear in the current continuum image, but may be there after better calibration (e.g. self-calibration).  VLA 20

% EDJ2009-237: Set2_ID13_3; Per-emb 60: Set2_ID14; EDJ2009-172: Set2_ID15

Figure\,\ref{fig:continuum} shows the continuum emission along with the fitted shapes, while Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list} lists the properties of the continuum sources.  The continuum emission peak appears as a compact circular or elliptical shape.  Some sources show extended continuum emission resembling the shape of outflow cavities, such as Per-emb 22 A and B.  Three sources, EDJ2009-237, Per-emb 60, and EDJ2009-172, show no spectral line and no reliable measurement of source velocity in literature; therefore, we exclude them from spectral extraction as well as the line identification and modeling.  However, these three sources still contribute to the total number of sources for calculating the detection statistics.

The observations resolve or marginally resolve 90\% (45 of 50) of the continuum sources.  Our sample includes single sources as well as resolved and unresolved multiple systems.  According to the VANDAM survey \citep{2016ApJ...818...73T}, our sample contains eleven binary systems and one triple system.  Two of eleven binary systems are resolved and the triple system appears as a single source and an unresolved binary.  In total, 20\%\ of the sources are unresolved binary. 

The averaged continuum brightness temperature (\tbc) traces the dust mass for optically thin emission, while the dust emission from the center of protostars may be marginally optically thick at ALMA Band 6 \citep{2020ApJ...889..172K}, making the derived dust mass lower limits.  The \tbc\ of PEACHES protostars increases linearly with the central dust mass of Perseus protostars derived with the 1\,mm ALMA and 9\,mm VLA observations \citep{2020arXiv200602812T} except for Per-emb 54, suggesting that \tbc\ probes the central dust mass without significant impact of optical depth (Figure\,\ref{fig:Tb_M}).

  \label{fig:Tb_M}
\end{figure}

Seven sources in our sample have \tbc\ $>$ 10\,K (Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list}).  NGC 1333\,IRAS\,4A1 has a \tbc\ of 21.9\,K, the brightest among our sample.  In fact, continuum opacity limits the detectability of COMs toward 4A1, where COMs appear as absorption at ALMA Band 7 \citep{2019ApJ...872..196S} and emission at centimeter wavelengths \citep{2020ApJ...896L...3D}.  Toward the other six sources, Per-emb 33 A, NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B1, Per-emb 5, B1-b S, and Per-emb 11 A, our observations detect several molecular lines from the central region, suggesting that the continuum opacity has less impact compared to that for IRAS 4A1.  Previous observations also suggest less impact from the continuum opacity for NGC 1333 IRAS 4B1 \citep{2020AA...635A.198B} and B1-b S \citep{2018AA...620A..80M}.  Most of the sources show averaged brightness temperatures lower than 10\,K, suggesting that the continuum sources remain unresolved and have a negligible effect to the COMs emission.  We take the \tbc\ as a tracer of the averaged gas column densities.  Constraining the actual column densities requires higher resolution observations and insights on the dust properties.

\subsection{Spectral Extraction}
The ALMA image cubes are post-processed to extract 1D spectra for identifying the emission of complex molecules and further analyses.  COMs typically desorb from dust grains at $T \gtrsim 100$\,K, which coincidentally corresponds to $\sim 100$\,au for typical embedded protostars \citep[e.g., ][]{2020ApJ...891...61Y}.  Given the spatial resolution of $\sim$0\farcs{5} ($\sim$150\,au at 300\,pc), we focus on the spectra toward the continuum sources to search for the COMs in the inner envelope.  In most of the cases, COMs emission concentrates around the protostars at $\lesssim$300\,au scale.  Figure\,\ref{fig:coms_map_sample} shows representative sample of the COMs emission, while the maps for the entire sample are shown in Appendix\,\ref{sec:coms_maps}.  Three steps of post-processing reduces the image cubes to 1D spectra, which are summarized below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extracting spectra:  We use the CASA task \texttt{specflux} to extract the mean flux density within the ellipse which has the same major and minor axes as well as the position angle as the fitted continuum sources.
  \item Baseline calibration:  The continuum has been removed before the imaging process; however, the extracted spectra sometimes still show imperfect baselines due to rich emission lines, lack of emission, and broad features.  Thus, we manually select the frequency ranges for baseline calibration for each spectral window and each field.
  \item Velocity correction:  Finally, the frequency of the extracted spectra are corrected according to the source velocities.  We collect the source velocities from the literature as well as from the strong emission lines in our spectra, such as SO and CS.  Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list} lists the adopted source velocities and the corresponding references.

\subsection{Line Identification and Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
Line identification starts with manual identification and verification for a few sources with rich spectra, including Per-emb-12B and B1-bS.  We use \textsc{splatalogue}\footnote{\href{http://www.splatalogue.net/}{http://www.splatalogue.net/}} to identity the molecular species and use \textsc{xclass} \citep{2017AA...598A...7M} to verify the identification.  The \textsc{xclass} package is a LTE radiative transfer code that uses the molecular data from the Cologne Database of Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS; \citealt{2001AA...370L..49M,2005JMoSt.742..215M,2016JMoSp.327...95E}) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; \citealt{1998JQSRT..60..883P}).  Appendix\,\ref{sec:catalogs} summarizes the individual catalogs relevant for each species.  An identification needs to satisfy the following criteria.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectra agree with the predicted strengths of the model.
  \item The spectral lines are not all blended with other emission, such as other molecules and the SiO emission tracing the outflows.  The emission of a few species, such as HDCO \&\ \tmethanol, \methanol\ \&\ \methylformate, \acetaldehyde\ \&\ \dmethanol, $^{34}$SO \&\ \ethanol, and \dimethylether\ \&\ \dmethylcyanide, are partially blended (blending occurs at a few lines but other lines remain isolated).  The fittings of those species are performed together to verify their identification.
  \item Identified molecules need to be already found toward young stellar objects as summarized in \citet{2018ApJS..239...17M}.
\end{itemize}
Table\,\ref{tbl:line_id} lists the identified species and transitions that are detected in at least one of the PEACHES protostars.  Only identifiable transitions are listed.  The \textsc{xclass} modeling include all the transitions in our frequency coverage for each molecule regardless their Einstein-A values and upper energy levels.  

As shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:coms_map_sample}, COMs emission centers around the protostars at $\sim 100-200$\,au.  At the similar region, the gas density is around $\sim 10^{9}--10^{12}$\cc, if we use the averaged continuum brightness temperature to estimate the gas column density and assume the same size in the radial direction as that in the plane of sky (Appendix\,\ref{sec:n_gas}).  We follow a similar procedure demonstrated in \citet{2016AA...595A.117J} that calculates the difference between the excitation temperature and the kinetic temperature modeled with non-LTE radiative transfer calculations using RADEX \citep{2007AA...468..627V}.  For one of the two most detected \methanol\ transitions at 261805.68\mhz, the $T_\text{ex}$ agrees with the $T_\text{k}$ within 10--30\%\ depending on the column density of \methanol.  The disagreement increases toward lower gas density where \methanol\ starts to mase, resulting the sharp increase of the deviation.  The calculation for the most detected \methanol\ line at 243915.79\mhz\ shows a negligible difference between $T_\text{ex}$ and $T_\text{k}$.

The results with \methanol\ column densities of 10$^{16}$, 10$^{17}$, and 10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$ are shown in dotted, dashed, and solid lines, respectively, while the results with $T_\text{k}$ of 100, 200, and 300\,K are shown in decreasing transparency.  The legends indicate the combination of $N_{\rm CH3OH}$ and $T_\text{k}$ as ($N_\text{CH3OH}$, $T_\text{k}$).}

\end{figure}

Systematic spectral fitting using \textsc{xclass} is applied to all sources using a list of species, compiled from the identifications.  The fitting function in \textsc{xclass} includes several optimization algorithms that can be used in series to reduce biases.  We configure the algorithm chain that starts with the genetic algorithm followed by the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization.  The genetic algorithm searches the best-fitting parameters iteratively with generations that evolve like a natural selection, where the better fitting models get less modification over generations.  We setup the genetic algorithm to search for the top two best-fitting models with 30 generations.  Then, the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization applies to the two best-fitting models for 20 iterations to find the best-fitting models.  The genetic algorithm aims to find local minimums and the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization further finds the best-fitting models in the local minimums.  The two best-fitting models found by the genetic algorithm often very similar, suggesting that there is only one minimum.  To address the rare cases of two separated local minimums, we pick the model with the lower $\chi^{2}$ values from the two best-fitting models constrained by the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization.  

There are five parameters in the \textsc{xclass} modeling, the size of the emitting molecule ($r_\text{COM}$), the excitation temperature ($T_\text{ex}$), the column density ($N_\text{COM}$), the line width ($\Delta \nu$), and velocity offset ($v_\text{off}$).  We assume the COMs are all concentrated at the center, simplified as a 2D thin circular disk.  We set $r_\text{COM}$ as 0\farcs{5}, similar to our beam size, and optimize the model with five excitation temperatures, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 K.  We allow the line width varying between 1.2\kms\ to 3.5\kms\ for better fitting quality but assume no velocity offset from the source velocity, and the allowed range of the column density for each molecule is chosen according to the strength of the emission.  From the fitting results of five $T_\text{ex}$, if a molecule is detected, the mean column densities will be the best-fitting column density, while the range of the column densities indicates the upper and lower uncertainties.  If a molecule is non-detection, the synthetic spectra for all lines are scaled to match the peaks of the each line fitted by a Gaussian profile.  Then, we take the minimum of the corresponding column densities as the upper limit.  The fitted column density is the column density within a radius of 0\farcs{5}, which relates to the averaged column density within the continuum emission by a factor of $\frac{0\farcs{5}^{2}}{\theta_\text{c, maj}\,\theta_\text{c, min}}$, where $\theta_\text{c, max}$ and $\theta_\text{c, min}$ are the continuum size along the major and minor axes, respectively.  Figure\,\ref{fig:svs13a} shows an example of the fitted spectra for SVS 13 A, assuming $T_\text{ex} = 150$\,K.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Detection Statistics}
We summarize the detection statistics in Figure\,\ref{fig:stats}, which includes COMs, the carbon-chain molecules, and the simple organic molecules, such as CS, \htcn, SO, $^{34}$SO, and SO$_{2}$.  In the following results of detection fraction, we include the three sources that are excluded from modeling due to no reliable source velocity, making a total of 50 sources.  The COMs discussed here are derived from the spectra taken toward the continuum peak (Section\,\ref{sec:continuum}).  We focus on the chemistry of COMs toward the disk-forming regions in this study, therefore, excluding detections of molecules outside the continuum peak.  A comparison of chemical composition in protostellar envelopes (100--1000\,au) requires observations with larger maximum recoverable scale ($\theta_\text{MRS}$).

The PEACHES protostars show a diverse chemistry of COMs from no molecule detected (e.g., B1-b N and L1455 IRS 2) to rich spectra of COMs (e.g., Per-emb 13).  Most of the PEACHES protostars have simple organics, such as SO, CS, \htcn, and HDCO, and $\sim 60$\%\ of sources have SO$_{2}$ and $^{34}$SO.  Emission of \cch\ can be easily identified from the spectra.  However, the \cch\ toward the continuum sources often shows irregular line profiles together with velocity offsets and absorption (Figure\,\ref{fig:all_cch}).  Warm environments, such as the outflow cavity wall, easily enhance the abundance of \cch\ because of the elevated abundance of C$^{+}$ \citep[e.g., ][]{2018ApJ...864...76Z,2019ApJ...873L..21I}.  Thus, \cch\ emission tends to extend along with the outflow cavities, making the 1D spectra toward the continuum source unrepresentative of the abundance of \cch.

Several sources have broad SiO emission, significantly contaminating the emission of \ethylcyanide\ and \acetaldehyde.  In the later quantitative discussion, we exclude the spectral windows contaminated by the SiO emission (spw10\_spw11).  For assigning the detections, we can distinguish the emission of \ethylcyanide\ and \acetaldehyde\ from the broad SiO emission in a few sources, such as \acetaldehyde\ in Per-emb 26.

Figure\,\ref{fig:detection_summary} shows the number of COMs detected toward the PEACHES sample.  Twenty-nine (58\%) sources have COMs detected.  \methanol\ is detected in 28 sources (56\%); \methylformate\ is detected in 14 sources (28\%); and N-bearing COMs are detected in 20 sources (40\%).  Comparing to the COMs in the CALYPSO survey \citep{2020AA...635A.198B}, the fraction of sources that have methanol, $\sim$50\%, is similar to that for the PEACHES protostars.  Also, 30\%\ of the CALYPSO sources have at least three COMs, while 28\%\ of the PEACHES protostars have at least three COMs.

We compare the number of detected COMs with the bolometric luminosity (\lbol), the bolometric temperature (\tbol), and the \tbc.  The number of COMs shows no obvious trend with \lbol, \tbol, and \tbc.  For \lbol, the sources with at least three COMs all have \lbol\ $\gtrsim$ 3\msun, except for B1-b S.  However, the sources without any COMs also have a similar \lbol.  If COMs mostly come from thermal desorption, the region with $T > T_\text{desorption}$ may be smaller for the low luminosity sources, making the emission of COMs fainter and reducing our sensitivity to detect COMs.
The COM-rich sources have \tbol$\sim 50$\,K, while the COM-poor sources have a greater scatter of \tbol, ranging from 14.7\,K to 1100\,K.  The number of detected COMs also show little trend with \tbc.  

% hot corino fraction and new hot corinos
Compact emission of COMs ($\sim$100--300\,au) suggests a warm temperature ($\gtrsim$100\,K) of COMs for a typical low-mass protostars \citep[e.g. ][]{2017ApJ...835..259Y}, consistent with an origin of thermal desorption at the inner envelope, so called hot corinos \citep{2004ASPC..323..195C}.  Only L1448 IRS 3A shows extended \methanol\ emission, and B1-b N shows no \methanol\ emission toward the continuum but peaks at $\sim$1\arcsec\ away from the continuum, hinting the existence of \methanol\ toward the continuum source blocked by opaque continuum \citep{2018AA...620A..80M}.  Excluding L1448 IRS 3A, 28 sources (56\%) have hot corinos type chemistry.  Many of hot corinos inn Perseus are previously known \citep[e.g., ][]{2004ApJ...615..354B,2007AA...463..601B,2018AA...620A..80M,2019MNRAS.483.1850B}, while our survey detects COMs other than \methanol\ for the first time toward Per-emb 35 A, Per-emb 35 B, Per-emb 11 A, and HH 211 MMS.

\subsection{Column Densities}
\subsubsection{Excitation Temperatures}
The PEACHES spectra cover four methanol lines.  However, the spectra of each source only include three of them due to the frequency shift in the wide spectral window.  The three methanol lines have upper energy ranging from $\sim$50\,K to $\sim$500\,K, which allows us to estimate the rotational temperature of methanol if all three lines are detected.  To construct the methanol rotational diagram, we fit the methanol emission with a Gaussian profile and fit for the rotational temperature.  The fitting assumes no optical depth correction as we only have three transitions to fit a straight line, which has two parameters.  The \methanol\ emission at 243915\mhz\ may be affected by optical depth, especially in Per-emb 44, Per-emb 12 B, Per-emb 18, and Per-emb 29, where the \methanol\ line fitting excludes the emission between 243914\mhz\ and 342918\mhz\ to minimize the impact of the optical depth.  This crude estimate of the excitation temperature serves as a guide for our assumption for excitation temperature in modeling the spectra (Section\,\ref{sec:modeling}).  Figure\,\ref{fig:rot_dia_example} shows the rotational diagram of Per-emb 22 B along with the fitted rotational temperature.  The derived rotational temperature of methanol ranges from 140\,K to 350\,K with considerable uncertainties, $\pm \sim 100$ K (Table\,\ref{tbl:methanol_rot_temps}).

For the sources with significant emission of \methylformate, we can constrain both the column density and the excitation temperature with the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method to further explore the uncertainties of the fitted properties.  We use \textsc{xclass} for the MCMC modeling, which uses the affine-invariant MCMC package \textsc{emcee} \citep{2013PASP..125..306F}.  Table\,\ref{tbl:mf_temp} lists the sources which have sufficient detections of \methylformate\ and the derived properties of \methylformate.  The best-fitting temperatures range from 100-300\,K, consistent with our assumption of the excitation temperatures.  Figure\,\ref{fig:corner_mf} shows an example of the posterior distributions of the fitting parameters toward B1-b S.  The posterior distribution of the excitation temperature has a longer tail toward high temperature, an upper averaged uncertainty of 71.6 K compared to a lower averaged uncertainty of 29.3 K.

\subsubsection{The Double-peaked Features of Per-emb 17}
\label{sec:per17}
Per-emb 17 is a close binary system with a separation of 83.3$\pm$4.0 au \citep{2018ApJ...867...43T}.  While observations show multiple velocity components and a velocity gradient similar to that of a disk, the dominant source for the velocity structure remains unclear.  Our observations of Per-emb 17 show clear double-peaked features for most emission, challenging our standard modeling pipeline that assumes a simple Gaussian line profile.  Thus, we model the spectra of Per-emb 17 separately from the entire sample.  In \textsc{xclass}, we set up two components of molecular gas using the same assumptions described in Section\ref{sec:modeling}.  Then, we configure the fitting to allow both components varying their velocity offset from the rest frequency by $\pm$5\kms.  The two velocity components for the emission of COMs appear at 1.96\kms\ and $-$3.15\kms\ on average, while the simple organics appear at slightly smaller velocity offsets.  We reserve detailed analyses about the kinematics of Per-emb 17 for future studies.  The fitting results become less robust with the additional parameters of velocity offsets due to the blending of the double-peaked lines.  Thus, we perform a two-components fitting with fixed velocity offsets at 1.96\kms\ and $-$3.15\kms, which reproduces the observations well (Figure\,\ref{fig:per17}).  To minimize the uncertainty due to substantial line-blending, we estimate the total column density from the sum of the two components instead of reporting them individually.  Then, we apply the same procedure to derive the mean column densities and upper limits as discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:modeling}.  Line blending still prevents accurate determinations of column densities for a few species.  In particular, the emission of \dimethylether\ at $\sim$259310\mhz\ may be underestimated or severely contaminated by the emission of \dmethylcyanide, which has another transition at spw10\_spw11 that may be contaminated by SiO emission.

\subsubsection{Correlations of COMs}
The chemical evolution of protostars may leave certain patterns in the abundance of molecules as the dynamical evolution determines the density and temperature structures, which regulate chemical reactions.  Thus, the abundance of COMs and their correlations provide critical information to constrain the chemical evolution at embedded protostars.

As described in Section\,\ref{sec:modeling}, we fit the column density and line width with different excitation temperatures, resulting in a range of column density as its uncertainty.  To quantify the goodness of correlation, we calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$), which tests the linearity of two variables.  A simple calculation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient would ignore the uncertainties of the column density.  Thus, we use the bootstrapping method to sample the fitted column densities to calculate Pearson's $r$, by assuming a normal distribution centers on the best-fitted values with the uncertainty as the width of the normal distribution.  If we include the upper limits as normal distributions center on zero, the correlation coefficient becomes significantly lower due to the cluster of samples around zero column density (Figure\,\ref{fig:pearson_distribution}).  With the detection-only sample, the mean Pearson's $r_{d}$ is 0.87, as expected for a tight correlation, with a Gaussian-like distribution skewed toward lower values.  After including the upper limits, the mean Pearson's $r$ decreases to 0.58 with larger uncertainty (the 68\%\ credible interval increases by 35\%).  Thus, we only consider the detections for bootstrapping the Pearson's $r$ correlation coefficient.

Figure\,\ref{fig:corner} shows the correlations of several COMs selected from their detection rates as well as the ratios between species, which is discussed in Section\,\ref{sec:ratios}.  The column density of \methanol\ best correlates with that of \methylcyanide.  \citet{2020AA...635A.198B} also found the tight correlation between these two molecules from the CALYPSO survey, which has a selective sample.  The column densities of \dimethylether\ and \methylformate\ also show a tight correlation.  \methanol\ also correlates with more complex species (i.e. so called daughter species, \methylformate\ and \dimethylether) with a lower correlation coefficient than that between \methanol\ and \methylcyanide.  The correlations between \methylcyanide\ and more complex species also show the same behavior.  The decreasing strength of correlation with between the simple COMs and more complex COMs supports the hypothesis that \methanol\ and \methylcyanide\ are first generation species and \methylformate\ and \dimethylether\ are the second generation \citep{2009ARAA..47..427H}.  The correlations of \methanol, \methylcyanide, \methylformate, and \dimethylether\ with other COMs show positive trends; however, the correlations are driven by a few sources due to the low detection rate of other COMs (Figure\,\ref{fig:major_minor}).

The column densities shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:corner} and \ref{fig:major_minor} are the column densities within a 0\farcs{5} region.  The correlations remain similar for the column densities averaged within the continuum emission.  To directly compare the abundance of COMs, we normalize the column densities of COMs by the \tbc, which is a proxy of gas column density.  The normalized column densities of COMs show similar correlations as that of the column densities (Figure\,\ref{fig:corner_combined}).  We further normalize the ``abundance'' of COMs ($N_\text{COM}/T_\text{b, cont}$) with \lbol\ and \tbol\ to test the effect of the protostellar properties on the observed complex chemistry (Figure\,\ref{fig:corner_combined}, green and orange).  The \tbol\ traces the evolutionary stage of protostars with larger \tbol\ for more evolved protostars \citep{1993ApJ...413L..47M,1995ApJ...445..377C}; and the \lbol\ indicates the size of the warm inner envelope as the accretion luminosity dominates the \lbol\ for Class 0/I protostars \citep{2014prpl.conf..195D}  After the normalization with \lbol\ and \tbol, the correlation coefficients remain similar for most cases.  \citet{2020arXiv200506784V} finds a similar irrelevance between the occurrence of COMs and the protostellar luminosity.  

Normalized with \lbol\ and \tbol, the correlation between \methanol\ and \dimethylether\ decreases significantly, while \methylcyanide\ also shows a considerable decrease of correlation with \dimethylether.  However, the correlations between \methylformate\ and \dimethylether\ remain similar with different normalizations.  Per-emb 17 is an outlier with low and uncertain abundance of \dimethylether\ (Section\,\ref{sec:per17}), reducing the correlation strength.  However, the correlation analyses excluding the abundance of Per-emb 17 show similar trends.  Thus, if we starts from \methanol, the correlation strength decreases as we move from \methylcyanide, \methylformate, and \dimethylether.

% The comparison between \cch\ and \methanol\ shows no correlation between these two molecules (Figure\,\ref{fig:cch_ch3oh}), similar to the conclusion in \citet{2018ApJS..236...52H}.  The single dish survey by \citet{2016ApJ...833..125G} shows a correlation between C$_{4}$H, a more complex carbon-chain molecules, and \methanol.  Outflow activity can promote the formation of \cch, which is more efficiency at warm temperature \citep[e.g., ][]{2018ApJ...864...76Z,2019ApJ...873L..21I}.  In face, the morphology of \cch\ often traces the outflow cavities seen from CS.  Therefore, the lack of correlation between \cch\ and \methanol\ may be affected by the inner cavity wall of outflows, because our spectra are taken toward the continuum peak.  Observations with a larger $\theta_\text{MRS}$ will minimize the effect of missing flux in interferometry for a faithful comparison of the \cch\ abundance on the inner envelope.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Universal Chemistry among Hot Corinos?}
For the protostars with compact emission of COMs, so called hot corinos, the abundance of COMs correlates well between species.  With the normalization of \tbc, the Pearson's $r$ for the correlations between the four major species (\methanol, \methylcyanide, \methylformate, and \dimethylether) are 0.76--0.93 (Figure\,\ref{fig:corner_combined}).  The Pearson's $r$ for the four major species with all COM species has a median value of 0.86 with a range from 0.57 to 0.95 (Figure\,\ref{fig:major_minor}).  The correlations remain strong with the normalizations of \lbol\ and \tbol, suggesting that the chemistry of COMs may be independent of the evolutionary stage of protostars.  The limited number of detections for the four major COMs with all COMs prohibits us to further quantify their correlation strengths.  While the PEACHES protostars show similar ratios of COMs, the absolute column densities of COMs vary by 1--3 orders of magnitude, hinting similar chemical pathways of COMs for embedded protostars in different environments.

We further test the effect of protostellar evolution with the abundance ratios of the four major COMs (Figure\,\ref{fig:ratios_indicators}).  The ratios of \methylcyanide/\methanol\ and \dimethylether/\methylformate, which are molecules with a similar complexity, have little variation as the functions of \lbol, \tbol, and \tbc.  In contrast, the ratios of \methylformate\ or \dimethylether\ to \methanol\, which are the molecules with more complexity over the molecules with less complexity, increases with \tbc, whereas the ratios show tentatively decreases with \lbol\ and \tbol.  The ratios of \methylformate\ and \dimethylether\ to \methylcyanide\ have similar trends as that with \methanol.  Because of its high abundance, methanol may be more optical thick at a higher gas column density (high \tbc), resulting in an underestimation of methanol column density, hence the elevated ratios.  The emission of \methylcyanide\ is likely to be optical thin given its low abundance compared to that of \methanol.  Therefore, the insignificant trend in ratios of \methylcyanide/\methanol\ with \tbc\ indicates a negligible role of optical depth.  Chemical evolution is an alternative scenario for such trend.  Under the scheme of grain-surface chemistry, \methanol\ primarily forms from the hydrogenation of CH$_3$O or CH$_2$OH, while \methylformate\ primarily forms from the reaction of HCO and CH$_3$O and \dimethylether\ primarily forms from the reaction of CH$_3$ and CH$_3$O \citep{2008ApJ...682..283G}.  Thus, the elevated ratios of \methylformate\ and \dimethylether\ to \methanol\ hint a higher abundance of HCO and CH$_3$ at high \tbc\ sources for more efficient formation of \methylformate.

\citet{2018ApJS..236...52H} find a tentative trend that the sources closer to the edge of the cloud or the isolated sources show a higher ratio of \cch\ to \methanol.  With the spectra toward the continuum sources, we can test the correlation between the abundance of COMs and the location of the sources in the cloud.  We follow the same approach described in \citet{2018ApJS..236...52H} to calculate the minimum distance from the source to the edge of the cloud that is arbitrarily defined as the 10$\sigma$ level in the Planck 217\ghz\ observations\footnote{Based on observations obtained with Planck (\href{http://www.esa.int/Planck}{http://www.esa.int/Planck}), an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States, NASA, and Canada.}.  The minimum distance has no obvious effect to the normalized column density of \methanol\ (Figure\,\ref{fig:Dmin}).  The abundance of \cch\ may increase at small minimum distance, which requires a comprehensive analysis of the \cch\ emission to confirm that will be present in future papers.

\subsection{The Abundance Ratios of O-bearing and N-bearing COMs}
\label{sec:ratios}

The abundance ratios of COMs represent the chemistry of COMs.  Figure\,\ref{fig:ratios_all} compares the abundance ratios of COMs toward the PEACHES protostars to the ratios from the CALYPSO survey \citep{2020AA...635A.198B}, the observations of individual protostars, and the model predictions from \citet{2013ApJ...765...60G}.  \citet{2020AA...635A.198B} divide up the CALYPSO sample into three groups, where Group 1 has low abundance of O-bearing COMs to \methanol; Group 2 are the fiducial sample; and Group 3 has enhanced and reduced abundance relative \methanol\ for the cyanide and O-bearing COMs.  The abundance ratios of COMs toward the PEACHES protostars generally agree with the ratios from the CALYPSO survey, which is expected due to the significantly overlapped sample.  Three of four sources in Group 2 are Perseus protostars.  Interestingly, the ratios of COMs in the PEACHES protostars are higher than that of well-known hot corinos, such as IRAS 16293$-$2422 B.  The high column density of \methanol, $\gtrsim 10^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$ may increase the detectability of COMs toward these individual sources, and the column densities of \methanol\ may be underestimated due to the optical depth.  The ratios of COMs toward the PEACHES protostars differ from the ranges of the peak abundance ratios in the warm-up models by \citet{2013ApJ...765...60G}, where the models underestimate the abundance ratios for most of the O-bearing COMs except for \glycolaldehyde\ and are consistent with the ratios of N-bearing COMs.

The well correlated abundance of N-COMs and O-COMs indicates no ``N-/O-bearing COMs differentiation,'' which is suggested for Orion-KL, a massive star-forming region \citep[e.g., ][]{2008Ap&SS.313...45G,2008ApJ...672..962F,2015AA...581A..71F,2018AA...620L...6T}.  The N-COMs and O-COMs segregate toward the hot core and the compact ridge of Orion-KL, respectively, which has been interpreted as a result of different temperatures at the prestellar phase or different chemical evolutionary stage \citep{1993ApJ...408..548C,2011JPCA..115.6472N,2011ApJ...728...71L,2013ApJ...765...60G}.  If the Perseus protostars have different initial conditions at the prestellar stage or are in different chemical stage that would result in a similar differentiation in Orion-KL, we would expect to detect a variety of N-COMs/O-COMs ratios.  However, the well correlated abundance of N-COMs and O-COMs suggests that the Perseus protostars may form from a similar initial temperature or be in a similar chemical stage.

The column densities of COMs toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B are taken from \citet{2016AA...595A.117J} for \methanol, \citet{2018AA...620A.170J} for \ethanol, \dimethylether, \methylformate, \acetaldehyde, \formamide, and \glycolaldehyde, \citet{2018AA...616A..90C} for \methylcyanide\ and \ethylcyanide.

  \label{fig:ratios_all}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Origin of the \methanol/\methylcyanide\ Correlation}
The tight correlation between \methanol\ and \methylcyanide\ is a striking finding of the PEACHES survey, while studies such as \citet{2017ApJ...841..120B,2020AA...635A.198B} have shown a similar trend with fewer detections or larger scatter.  \citet{2020AA...635A.198B} argue that this correlation between \methanol\ and \methylcyanide\ may not be due to chemistry because of the somewhat unrelated formation pathways of two molecules.  If the gas-phase chemistry is negligible for the production of \methanol\ and \methylcyanide, the tight correlation between \methanol\ and \methylcyanide\ suggests a similar abundance ratio of two molecules on the icy grains prior to being thermally desorbed.  Thus, the chemical processes that produce these two molecules may occur at a much shorter timescale compared to the dynamical scale of the protostellar evolution, hinting a universal chemistry of COMs at the warm protostellar envelope.  The tight correlation may also reflect a uniform elemental abundance of O and N in the Perseus molecular cloud before the star formation.

The compact emission of \methanol\ has a well known icy origin, where \methanol\ forms via the hydrogenation on the surface of dust grains.  At cold temperature, the non-thermal desorption and/or the excessive energy from the formation of \methanol\ that kicks it off from dust grains are thought to responsible for the production of \methanol.  \methylcyanide\ can also form in gas-phase via radiative association (HCN $+$ CH$_3^+$ $\rightarrow$ CH$_3$CNH$^+$ $+$ $h\nu$) followed by the dissociative recombination of CH$_3$CNH$^+$ or on the grain surface.  The grain-surface reactions to form \methylcyanide\ can occur at cold temperature by the hydrogenation of CCN, which can form via C$+$CN, C$_2+$N, or direct depletion of CCN onto dust grains.  At warm temperature, \methylcyanide\ can form directly from reactions between radicals, CH$_3$ and CN.  For embedded protostars, the grain-surface reactions are thought to dominate the production of \methylcyanide; however, it remains unclear whether the cold phase or warm phase grain-surface pathway regulates the abundance of \methylcyanide.  

If we assume an icy grain origin for both \methanol\ and \methylcyanide, we can test the efficiency of the cold and warm phase pathways by comparing the ratio of \methylcyanide/\methanol\ toward the prestellar and protostellar sources.  At prestellar cores, [\methylcyanide/\methanol] are 0.28, 0.039, and 0.042 for TMC\,1 \citep{2016ApJS..225...25G}, L1521 E \citep{2019AA...630A.136N}, and L1544 \citep{2019AA...630A.136N}, respectively, all of which are higher than the ratio in our survey, 0.012$^{+0.009}_{-0.005}$.  The decreases of [\methylcyanide/\methanol] from prestellar to protostellar phase suggests that the warm phase grain-surface chemistry plays a rather insignificant role for the production of \methylcyanide\ and/or the gas-phase chemistry is more efficient at the cold phase to produce additional \methylcyanide.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This work presents the PEACHES survey, an unbiased chemistry survey of COMs toward 50 Class 0/I protostars at the Perseus molecular cloud using ALMA Band 6 observations.  The main conclusions are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Perseus Class 0/I protostars commonly (58\%) show warm COMs emission.  \methanol\ is the most detected species of COMs, while our observations show the emission of 12 O-bearing COMs and 4 N-bearing COMs, including isotopologues.
  \item The good correlations between the most detect COMs, \methanol, \methylcyanide, \methylformate, and \dimethylether, as well as between these COMs and other fewer detected COMs hint a universal chemistry of COMs for the Perseus embedded protostars.  Protostellar properties, such as \lbol, the evolutionary indicator, such as \tbol, and the minimum distance to the cloud edge, have little impact to the number of detected COMs and the abundance of COMs.
  \item \methylformate\ and \dimethylether\ are the most abundant COMs other than \methanol\ with abundance ratios to \methanol\ of 0.22$^{+0.17}_{-0.10}$ and 0.21$^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$, respectively.  The abundance of COMs to \methanol\ in the Perseus protostars are significantly higher than that of the well-known hot corinos, such as IRAS 16293$-$2422 B, although our model may underestimate of the \methanol\ column density due to its high optical depth.  The abundance ratios of N-bearing COMs agree with the model predictions by\citet{2013ApJ...765...60G}, which underestimates the abundance of the O-bearing COMs.
  \item A similar composition of \methanol\ and \methylcyanide\ on the icy grains for the Perseus protostars may result in the observed extremely well correlated column densities of \methanol\ and \methylcyanide.  
  \item The elevated abundance ratio of \methylcyanide\ to \methanol\ at the prestellar phase indicates a more efficient gas-phase chemistry to produce \methylcyanide\ at the cold phase or an insignificant role of the warm-phase grain-surface chemistry for the abundance of \methylcyanide\ at the protostellar phase.
  \item The ratios of more complex COMs, such as \methylformate\ and \dimethylether, to the less complex COMs, such as \methanol\ and \methylcyanide, increase as the averaged continuum brightness temperature, a proxy of the gas column density, suggesting an enhanced production of more complex COMs toward more embedded sources.

\section{The Spectra of \cch}
% The \cch\ spectra toward the continuum emission have irregular line profiles.  Some spectra have strong self-absorption, while some spectra only show the blue-shifted emission.  Due to the absorption and irregular line profile, the \textsc{xclass} fitting routine often fails to faithfully reproduce the observed \cch\ spectra.  \cch\ can easily form in the outflow cavity wall due to the abundant CH$_{4}$ sublimated from dust grains as well as C$^+$ ionized by the UV radiation.  Thus, the \cch\ spectra can have broad line width and multiple components.  Furthermore, the morphology of the \cch\ emission traces the outflows, making our extraction from the continuum emission non-ideal for representing the nature of the \cch\ emission.  \textcolor{red}{Figure\,\ref{fig:all_cch} and Y show the spectra and the moment 0 map of \cch, respectively.}

\section{Estimation of the column and volume gas density}
\label{sec:n_gas}
The continuum brightness temperature indirectly measures the gas column density assuming an optically thin emission.  Within the extraction region for the 1D spectra, we can estimate the gas column density from the averaged continuum brightness temperature using
\begin{align}
  N_{\rm gas} \text{(g cm$^{-2}$)} & = \frac{R_{\rm g2d}<I_{\nu}>}{\kappa_{\nu}B_{\nu}(T_{\rm d})} \nonumber \\
  N_{\rm gas} \text{(cm$^{-2}$)} & = \frac{R_{\rm g2d}<I_{\nu}>}{\kappa_{\nu}B_{\nu}(T_{\rm d})\mu m_{\rm H}},
\end{align}
where $R_{\rm g2d}$ is the gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, $<I_{\nu}>$ is the averaged intensity, $\kappa_{\nu}$ is the dust opacity, $B_{\nu}(T_{\rm d})$ is the Planck function at $T_{\rm d}$, which is assumed as 30\,K, and $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight of 2.37.  We assume a frequency of 250\ghz.  Furthermore, we can estimate the volume density assuming the emitting gas has the same spatial extent along the line of sight as that along the plane of sky.  Figure\,\ref{fig:Ngas_ngas} shows the estimated column and volume gas densities of the PEACHES protostars.
