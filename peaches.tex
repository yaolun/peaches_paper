Planet formation may start during the embedded phase of star formation.  In the scenario where planets form from the embedded disks, resulting in substructures, the chemistry of embedded disks may play a significant role for the chemical composition of the forming planets.  In the recent years, observations discover the emission of carbon-chain molecules and complex organic molecules (COMs) toward the center of several embedded protostars, indicating that embedded protostars have developed a complex chemistry at the disk-forming region.  If the forming planets inherit the chemistry of embedded disks, the abundance of complex organic molecules may implicate future developments of organics on the planets. 

Heavier or more complex molecules, such as cyclic-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$, SO, and complex organic molecules (COMs), are in the gas phase at the inner protostellar envelope ($T\gtrsim100$\,K), exclusively tracing the properties of the inner envelope where a disk may be forming \citep{2013ChRv..113.8961A,2014Natur.507...78S}.  The kinematics of a rotating infalling envelope has been analyzed with the observations of heavier or more complex molecules, such as \methanol\ and \dmethanol\ for HH\,212 \citep{2017ApJ...843...27L}, CS for IRAS\,04365$+$2535 \citep{2016ApJ...820L..34S} and L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}, cyclic-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ for L1527 \citep{2014Natur.507...78S}, OCS for IRAS\,16293$-$2422\,A \citep{2016ApJ...824...88O}, and methanol and HCOOH for B335 \citep{2019ApJ...873L..21I}.

In the review by \citet{2009ARA&A..47..427H}, complex molecules are defined as carbon-bearing molecules that contain six atoms or more.  Saturated complex molecules are rich in hydrogen atoms, often called complex organic molecules (COMs), while the unsaturated complex molecules are lack of hydrogen atoms, mostly in the form of long carbon-chain molecules.  While recent observations show several embedded protostars with rich spectra of complex molecules, the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars and its relationship to the star formation process remain poorly understand.  Several protostars are rich in COMs but show little emission of long carbon-chain molecules, such as IRAS 16293$-$2422 \citep{2016A&A...595A.117J}, NGC 1333 IRAS 4A \citep{2004ApJ...615..354B}, B335 \citep{2016ApJ...830L..37I,2019ApJ...873L..21I}, and BHR\,71 (Yang et al. 2020 accepted); some protostars are rich in long carbon-chain molecules but not in COMs, such as L1527 \citep{2010ApJ...722.1633S} and IRAS 15398$-$3359 \citep{2009ApJ...697..769S}.  While the bimodal chemical appearance hints a bimodal evolutionary path, the chemical evolution at the embedded protostars remain ill-constrained as a few protostars show the emission of both COMs and long carbon-chain molecules at different scales, such as L483 \citep{2017ApJ...837..174O}. 

The Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES) aims to provide the statistics on the occurrence of complex molecules at embedded protostars.  This program unbiasedly observes 51 embedded protostars with ALMA around 260\,GHz, covering the emission of simple molecules such as CS and H$^{13}$CN as well as the emission of complex molecules including \methanol\ and \methylformate.

\section{Spectra Extraction}
The ALMA image cubes are post-processed to extract 1D spectra for identifying the emission of complex molecules and further analyses.  COMs typically desorb from dust grains at $T \gtrsim 100$\,K, which coincidentally corresponds to $\sim 100$\,au for typical embedded protostars (e.g., \citealt{2020ApJ...891...61Y}).  Given the spatial resolution of $\sim$0\farcs{5} ($\sim$150\,au), we focus on the spectra toward the continuum sources to search for the COMs in the inner envelope.  Four steps of post-processing reduces the image cubes to 1D spectra, which are summarized below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuum fitting: We use the CASA task \texttt{imfit} to iteratively fit for continuum sources down to 5$\sigma$ of the residual image within the central 70\%\ of the primary beam size (20\arcsec).  For the field Set3\_ID09, the fitting uses a threshold of 4$\sigma$ and extends the mask to the entire primary beam as a continuum source is detected toward the edge of the primary beam where the noise is elevated.
  \item Extracting spectra:  We use the CASA task \texttt{specflux} to extract the mean flux density within the ellipse which has the same major and minor axes as well as the position angle as the fitted continuum sources.
  \item Baseline calibration:  The continuum has been removed before the imaging process; however, the extracted spectra sometimes still show imperfect baselines due to rich emission lines, lack of emission, and broad emission features.  Thus, we manually select the frequency ranges for baseline calibration for each spectral window and each field.
  \item Velocity correction:  Finally, the frequency of the extracted spectra are corrected according to the source velocities.  We collect the source velocities from the literature as well as from the strong emission lines in our spectra, such as SO and CS.  Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list} lists the adopted source velocities and the corresponding references.
\end{itemize}

Figure\,\ref{fig:continuum} shows the continuum emission along with the fitted shapes, while the properties of the continuum sources are also listed in Table\,\ref{tbl:source_list}.  Our observations detect 50 continuum sources.    The continuum emission appears as compact circular or elliptical shape with no sub-structure.  Some sources show extended continuum emission resembling the shape of outflow cavities, such as Per-emb 22 A and B.  Three sources, EDJ2009-237, Per-emb 60, and EDJ2009-172, have no spectral line detected and no reliable measurement of source velocity in literature; therefore, we exclude them from spectral extraction as well as the line identification and modeling.  However, these three sources still contribute to the denominator for calculating the detection statistics.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Line Identification and Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
Line identification starts with manual identification and verification for a few sources with rich spectra, including Per-emb-12B and B1-bS.  We use \textsc{splatalogue}\footnote{\href{http://www.splatalogue.net/}{http://www.splatalogue.net/}} to identity the molecular species and use \textsc{xclass} \citep{2017A&A...598A...7M} to verify the identification.  The \textsc{xclass} package is a LTE radiative transfer code that uses the molecular data from the Cologne Database of Molecular Spectroscopy (CDMS; \citealt{2001A&A...370L..49M,2005JMoSt.742..215M,2016JMoSp.327...95E}) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; \citealt{1998JQSRT..60..883P}).  An identification needs to satisfy the following criteria.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The spectra agree with the predicted strengths of the model.
  \item The spectral lines are not all blended with other emission, such as other molecules and the SiO emission tracing the outflows.  The emission of a few species, such as HDCO \&\ \tmethanol, \methanol\ \&\ \methylformate, \acetaldehyde\ \&\ \dmethanol, $^{34}$SO \&\ \ethanol, and \dimethylether\ \&\ \dmethylcyanide, are partially blended (blending occurs at a few lines but other lines remain isolated).  The fittings of those species are performed together to verify their identification.
  \item Identified molecules need to be already found toward young stellar objects as summarized in \citet{2018ApJS..239...17M}.
\end{itemize}
Table\,\ref{tbl:line_id} lists the identified species and transitions that are detected in at least one of the PEACHES protostars.  Only identifiable transitions are listed.  The \textsc{xclass} modeling include all the transitions in our frequency coverage for each molecule regardless their Einstein-A values and upper energy levels.  

Systematic spectral fitting using \textsc{xclass} is applied to all sources using a list of species, compiled from the identifications.  Appendix\,\ref{sec:catalogs} lists the catalogs used in this study.  The fitting function in \textsc{xclass} includes several optimization algorithms that can be used in series to reduce biases.  We configure the algorithm chain that starts with the genetic algorithm followed by the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization.  The genetic algorithm searches the best-fitting parameters iteratively with generations that evolve like a natural selection, where the better fitting models get less modification over generations.  We setup the genetic algorithm to search for the top two best-fitting models with 30 generations.  Then, the Levenberg-Marquardt $\chi^{2}$ minimization applies to the two best-fitting models for 20 iterations to find the best-fitting models.  The genetic algorithm aims to find local minimums and the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization further finds the best-fitting models in the local minimums.  The two best-fitting models found by the genetic algorithm often very similar, suggesting that there is only one minimum.  To address the rare cases of two separated local minimums, we pick the model with the lower $\chi^{2}$ values from the two best-fitting models constrained by the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization.  

There are five parameters in the \textsc{xclass} modeling, the size of the emitting molecule ($r_\text{COM}$), the excitation temperature ($T_\text{ex}$), the column density ($N_\text{COM}$), the line width ($\Delta \nu$), and velocity offset ($v_\text{off}$).  We assume the COMs are all concentrated at the center, simplified as a 2D thin circular disk.  We fix $r_\text{COM}$ as 0\farcs{5}, similar to our beam size, and optimize the model with five excitation temperatures, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 K.  We allow the line width varying between 1.2\kms\ to 3.5\kms\ for better fitting quality but assume no velocity offset from the source velocity, and the allowed range of the column density for each molecule is chosen according to the strength of the emission.  From the fitting results of five $T_\text{ex}$, if a molecule is detected, the mean column densities will be the best-fitting column density, while the range of the column densities indicates the upper and lower uncertainties.  If a molecule is non-detection, the synthetic spectra for all lines are scaled to match the peaks of the each line fitted by a Gaussian profile.  Then, we take the minimum of the corresponding column densities as the upper limit.

\section{Detection Statistics}
We summarize the detection statistics in Figure\,\ref{fig:stats}, which includes COMs, the carbon-chain molecules, and the simple organic molecules, such as CS, \htcn, SO, $^{34}$SO, and SO$_{2}$.  In the following results of detection fraction, we include the three sources that are excluded from modeling due to no reliable source velocity, making a total of 50 sources.  The PEACHES protostars show a great chemical diversity from no molecule detected (e.g., B1-bN and L1455 IRS 2) to rich spectra of COMs (e.g. Per-emb 13).  Most of the PEACEHS protostars have simple organics, such as SO, CS, \htcn, and HDCO, and $\sim 60$\%\ of sources have SO$_{2}$ and $^{34}$SO.  Emission of CCH can be easily identified from the spectra.  However, the CCH toward the continuum sources often shows irregular line profiles together with velocity offsets and absorption (Figure\,\ref{fig:all_cch}).  In fact, warm environments, such as the outflow cavity wall, easily enhance the abundance of CCH because of elevated abundance of C$^{+}$.  Thus, CCH emission is extended along with the outflow cavities, making the 1D spectra unrepresentative.

Thirty-four percent of sources have no COMs detected (no emission nor absorption), including Per-emb 8, B1-bN, IRAS 4B$\prime$, Per-emb 36, Per-emb 33 B/C, Per-emb 50, Per-emb 14, Per-emb 28, Per-emb 41, Per-emb 37, Per-emb 11 B, Per-emb 16, Per-emb 55, EDJ2009-235, Per-emb 15, L1455 IRS 2, and Per-emb 54, in the order of decreasing continuum temperatures.  Methanol (\methanol) is detected in 28 sources (56\%); methyl formate (\methylformate) is detected in 15 sources (30\%); and N-bearing COMs are detected in 20 sources (40\%).  Comparing to the COMs in the CALYPSO survey \citep{2020A&A...635A.198B}, the fraction of sources that have methanol, $\sim$50\%, is similar to that for the PEACHES protostars.  Also, 30\%\ of the CALYPSO sources have at least three COMs, while 28\%\ of the PEACHES protostars have at least three COMs.  

The sources with rich spectra COMs tend to have bright continuum emission.  However, the brightest source in continuum, Per-emb 12 A has many molecules detected in absorption due to the high continuum opacity blocking the emission of COMs \citep{2019ApJ...872..196S}.  The number of detected COMs show no obvious correlation with the bolometric luminosity and bolometric temperature of the protostars (Figure\,\ref{fig:stats}), which are conventional evolutionary indicators.  Low luminosity sources have fewer COMs detected; however, if COMs mostly come from thermal desorption, the region with $T > T_\text{desorption}$ may be smaller for the low luminosity sources, making the emission of COMs fainter and reducing our sensitivity to detect COMs.  To test the detection statistics with physical properties of protostars, we collect the mass derived from 9\,mm observations that resolved the sources as a proxy of the central mass \citep{2018ApJS..238...19T}.  The detection statistics with the continuum mass show only tentative correlation with the central mass with smaller central mass have fewer detections of COMs.

Several sources have their SiO emission with a broad line width, significantly contaminating the emission of \ethylcyanide\ and \acetaldehyde.  In the later quantitative discussion, we exclude the spectral windows contaminated by the SiO emission.  For assigning the detections, we can distinguish the emission of \ethylcyanide\ and \acetaldehyde\ from the broad SiO emission in a few sources, such as \acetaldehyde\ in Per-emb 26.

\section{Correlations of COMs}
The chemical evolution of protostars may leave certain patterns in the abundance of molecules as the dynamical evolution determines the density and temperature structures, which regulate chemical reactions.  Thus, the abundance of COMs and their correlations provide critical information to constrain the chemical evolution at embedded protostars.  The fitted column density of COMs indicates the abundance of COMs around protostars.  Typically COMs are locked into the ices on dust grains at outer envelope. Therefore, we take the column density of COMs as a proxy of the abundance of COMs.  

As described in Section\,\ref{sec:modeling}, we fit the column density and line width with different excitation temperatures, resulting in a range of column density as its uncertainty.  The comparison between CCH and \methanol\ shows no correlation between these two molecules (Figure\,\ref{fig:cch_ch3oh}), similar to the conclusion in \citet{2018ApJS..236...52H}.  The single dish survey by \citet{2016ApJ...833..125G} shows a correlation between C$_{4}$H, a more complex carbon-chain molecules, and \methanol.  Outflow activity can promote the formation of CCH, which is more efficiency at warm temperature.  In face, the morphology of CCH often traces the outflow cavities seen from CS.  Therefore, the lack of correlation between CCH and \methanol\ may be affected by outflows.

Figure\,\ref{fig:corner} shows the correlations of several COMs selected from their detection rates.  The column density of \methanol\ best correlates with that of \methylcyanide.  \citet{2020A&A...635A.198B} also found the tight correlation between these two molecules from the CALYPSO survey, which has a selective sample.  The column densities of \dimethylether\ and \methylformate\ also show a tight correlation.  To quantify the goodness of correlation, we calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient ($r$), which tests the linearity of two variables.  A simple calculation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient would ignore the uncertainties of the column density.  Thus, we use the bootstrapping method to sample the fitted column densities to calculate Pearson's $r$, by assuming a normal distribution centers on the best-fitted values with the uncertainty as the width of the normal distribution.  If we include the upper limits as normal distributions center on zero, the correlation coefficient becomes significantly lower due to the cluster of samples around zero column density (Figure\,\ref{fig:pearson_distribution}).  With the detection-only sample, the mean Pearson's $r_{d}$ is 0.91, as expected for a tight correlation, with a Gaussian-like distribution skewed toward lower values.  After including the upper limits, the mean Pearson's $r$ decreases to 0.59 with larger uncertainty (the 68\%\ credible interval increases by 160\%).  Thus, the bootstrapped correlation coefficient only considers the detections.

\subsection{Excitation Temperatures}
\subsubsection{\methanol}
The PEACHES spectra cover four methanol lines, while the spectra of each source include three of them due to the frequency shift in the wide spectral window.  The three methanol lines have upper energy ranging from $\sim$50\,K to $\sim$500\,K, which allows us to estimate the rotational temperature of methanol if all three lines are detected.  To construct the methanol rotational diagram, we fit the methanol emission with a Gaussian profile and bootstrap the measurements for fitting the rotational temperature.  Figure\,\ref{fig:rot_dia_example} shows the rotational diagram of Per-emb 22 B along with the sampled rotational temperature.  The derived rotational temperature of methanol ranges from 120\,K to 240\,K with an exception of Per-emb 18, which has a rotational temperature of 395.7\,K for methanol (Table\,\ref{tbl:methanol_rot_temps}).

\section{The Spectra of CCH}
The CCH spectra toward the continuum emission have irregular line profiles.  Some spectra have strong self-absorption, while some spectra only show the blue-shifted emission.  Due to the absorption and irregular line profile, the \textsc{xclass} fitting routine often fails to faithfully reproduce the observed CCH spectra.  CCH can easily form in the outflow cavity wall due to the abundant CH$_{4}$ sublimated from dust grains as well as C$^+$ ionized by the UV radiation.  Thus, the CCH spectra can have broad line width and multiple components.  Furthermore, the morphology of the CCH emission traces the outflows, making our extraction from the continuum emission non-ideal for representing the nature of the CCH emission.  Figure\,\ref{fig:all_cch} and Y show the spectra and the moment 0 map of CCH, respectively.
